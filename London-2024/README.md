![Advanced Serverless Workshop - Azure](thumbnail.jpg)

Have you been doing serverless for a while but don’t feel like you’re getting the most out of it? This interactive workshop will allow you to interact with experienced serverless professionals and get three different perspectives on how to level up your serverless architecture.

- Learn new approaches and design patterns.
- Hear stories from the trenches about what worked (and what didn’t)
- Gain perspective on cost, performance, scalability, and resilience.
- Includes examples covering AWS Lambda, Azure Function, and Google Functions 

This four-part workshop is designed for experienced serverless developers and architects who want to deepen their knowledge, learn exciting new aspects of serverless technology, and network with other serverless experts. Some perspectives on the major platforms will be provided, but this workshop is intended for all practitioners, regardless of their current technology stack.

## Content & Process

### Unit 1: Designing Serverless Solutions - Michael Dowden

This workshop will focus on mapping real-world software challenges onto the technical solution space of Serverless architecture. The session consists of less than 30 minutes of presentation and more than 60 minutes of interactive exercises. The goal is to clearly illustrate how to break down real software problems using Serverless Architecture and how to choose between different competing approaches.

The introduction (< 30 mins) will include an interactive survey covering various aspects of Serverless design and an overview of strengths, weaknesses, and caveats, including an example scenario showing how the presenter designed a serverless solution.

The central part of the workshop (> 60 mins) will consist of a series of application scenarios in the model of:
\- Present the scenario
\- Participants take time to design solutions
\- Teams share their solutions
\- Instructor-led discussion of the pros/cons of different approaches

### Unit 2: Azure Serverless Solutions Demystified: Learn, Build, and Scale with Ease! - Chad Green

Dive into the world of serverless computing with Microsoft Azure in this comprehensive session covering architecture styles, cloud design patterns, and software design patterns essential for crafting efficient serverless solutions. Explore Azure's suite of serverless services and witness real-world examples of serverless solutions built using Azure. Engage in an interactive lab to design innovative serverless architectures, followed by a live demonstration showcasing a potential solution. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to serverless computing, this session equips you with the knowledge and tools to build scalable, resilient, and efficient applications in today's dynamic cloud environment.

### Unit 3:  More than a few Lambda functions - Lee Priest

One phrase that has echoed around the technology sphere is that “Serverless is just a bunch of Lambda functions.” This workshop will introduce you to the broader world of Serverless on AWS using a combination of architectural practices and AWS services. We'll dive into AWS services such as Step Functions, DynamoDB, EventBridge, API Gateway, SQS, and more, illustrating their use with practical examples.

Using real-world scenarios, we will explore potential solutions and which AWS resources would be suited to help us solve them. The workshop will start with an introduction and overview of a range of AWS Serverless services. It will then move into a more interactive stage where participants can team up to solve the scenarios using the AWS services discussed earlier.

### Unit 4: Serverless Discussion Panel

To wrap up our day of advanced serverless topics, please bring your questions for an interactive discussion with our workshop speakers. The three major serverless platforms will be represented, with Lee Priest covering AWS, Chad Green covering Azure, and Michael Dowden covering GCP. We're happy to answer questions that have come up throughout the day-long workshop, specific implementation questions about one of the platforms, or any other questions that have come up during your serverless journey.

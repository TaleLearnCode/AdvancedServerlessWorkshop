[Details from the Berlin 2022 conference.](Berlin2022.md)

## Description
Have you been doing serverless for awhile, but don’t feel like you’re getting the most out of it? This interactive workshop will give you the chance to interact with experienced serverless professionals and get three different perspectives on how you can level up your serverless architecture.

* Learn new approaches and design patterns
* Hear stories from the trenches about what worked (and what didn’t)
* Gain perspective on aspects such as cost, performance, scalability, and resilience
* Includes examples covering AWS Lambda, Azure Function, and Google Functions  

This four-part workshop is designed for experienced serverless developers and architects who want to deepen their knowledge, learn exciting new aspects of serverless technology and network with other serverless experts. Some perspective on the major platforms will be provided, but this workshop is intended for all practitioners regardless of their current technology stack.

## Content & Process
### Unit 1: "Serverless and AI: The Perfect Match" - Bryan Hogan

Working with Serverless technology requires a mindset-change - in other words, a mind-shift - to see your applications as event-driven orchestration of managed services. This demands a new way of thinking, architecting, developing, operating, and sustaining your applications from the legacy ways of the past. In this 'Go Granular To Move Faster With Serverless On AWS' workshop, we will look at three different concepts and see how they are interrelated and complement each other to implement solutions faster to bring benefits to your customers and add value to your business.

The workshop is divided into three parts, with each taking roughly 30 minutes. The initial part of the workshop focuses on how serverless enables us to go deeper and granular with the array of managed services available to architect, build, and operate our serverless applications. This part involves interactions with the audience to discuss and identify approaches and solutions for the simple use cases presented.

The second part will focus on an approach and mindset to break down traditional microservices and how we can take inspiration from Domain-Driven Design and the existing microservices principles but at the same time build better services to the strength of serverless. This part is more of curiosity creation and guiding the audience to think in a different way from a mere traditional approach.

The final part will show how to untangle some of the complexities teams face by using event-driven architecture and the patterns and tools available to build well-architected serverless solutions.

### Unit 2: "Beyond Hello World: Getting Deeper into Azure Functions" – Chad Green

By now, you surely have seen the HTTP trigger within Azure Functions.  Just about every presentation uses that trigger to show how awesome Azure Functions can be.  But there is so much more you can do with Azure Functions using the other built-in triggers and bindings, which make Azure Functions a fantastic tool in your tool chest for solving all sorts of problems.  So come and hear about these triggers and bindings and see real world examples of how they have been employed in different solutions to solve real customer needs.

The workshop will be divided into three sections.  The first section will focus on the different triggers and bindings with examples of how they can be used to solve real-world problems.  The second section will focus on best practices when employing Azure Functions learned from employing many different serverless solutions.  And the third section will be code-heavy demonstrations of how to employ advanced uses of Azure Functions.

### Unit 3: "Designing Serverless Solutions" – Michael Dowden

his workshop will focus on the challenge of mapping real-world software challenges onto the technical solution space of Serverless architecture. The session is composed of less than 30 minutes of presentation and more than 60 minutes of interactive exercises. The goal of this workshop is to clearly illustrate how to break down real software problems using Serverless Architecture and how to choose between different competing approaches.

The introduction (< 30 mins) will include an interactive survey covering various aspects of Serverless design, and an overview of strengths, weaknesses, and caveats including an example scenario showing how the presenter designed a serverless solution.

The main part of the workshop (> 60 mins) will consist of a series of application scenarios in the model of:

* Present the scenario
* Participants take time to design solutions
* Teams share their solutions
* Instructor-led discussion of the pros/cons of different approaches

### Unit 4: Serverless Discussion Panel – Sebastian Meyen

To wrap up our day of advanced serverless topics, please bring your questions for an interactive discussion with our workshop speakers. The three major serverless platforms will be represented with Sheen Brisals covering AWS, Chad Green covering Azure, and Michael Dowden covering GCP. We’re happy to answer questions that have come up throughout the day-long workshop, specific implementation questions about one of the platforms, or any other questions that have come up during your serverless journey.

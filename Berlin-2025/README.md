## Description
Learn about serverless architectures, patterns, and approaches with a panel of Serverless practitioners with experience in various industries and platforms. You'll work with panelists and other attendees to diagram patterns, design solutions, and build your toolbox of approaches to complex, real-world challenges. 

**Take your serverless skills to the next level** in this advanced workshop for developers and architects. Learn how to design resilient, scalable, and cost-effective serverless systems using proven patterns and tools. Collaborate with seasoned practitioners and other professionals to solve real-world challenges and expand your serverless toolbox. This workshop dives deep into the practical side of serverless computing. Designed for experienced engineers, it goes beyond the basics to explore real-world architectures, cross-platform design patterns, and modern development workflows. With a panel of industry experts, participants will tackle complex challenges, exchange field-tested strategies, and co-create solution diagrams for event-driven and microservice-based systems. The format combines short expert inputs with interactive group work to ensure hands-on learning and direct application.

**Key topics and focus areas include:**

- Advanced serverless design patterns and anti-patterns
- Event-driven architectures and orchestration strategies
- Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud considerations
- Observability, monitoring, and debugging in serverless systems
- Cost control and performance optimization
- Toolchains, frameworks, and deployment automation
- Real-world use cases from different industries
